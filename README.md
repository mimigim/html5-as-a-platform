# HTML5 as a Platform Assignment
## Overview
This is a simple website with three pages: Home, Video, and Form.

On the Home page, we inserted some javascript functionality to allow the page to access the device's camera and take a photo.
The javascript can be found in the photo.js file.

On the Video page, we inserted some HTML5 video. The user can hit play or pause, adjust volume, etc.

On the Form page, we created a contact form that accesses local storage for the required fields. There is also some validation that occurs for the required fields. Additionally, below the form, we've added an audio function so the user can listen to the audio file.

Any responsiveness on this website is purely accidental.

Contact jstamb02 or mimigim for further information.
